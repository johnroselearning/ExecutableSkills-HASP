"""Every skill module must import, and the library must be the size it claims.

`_load_pf_system` catches whatever a skill module raises so one bad file cannot
take down a rollout. The cost is that a module which fails to import leaves the
*previous* registration holding the skill id: the library still answers, still
reports skills, and quietly serves the pre-template implementations. That is
not a hypothetical — a one-line scoping bug in `pf_skill` took out all three
skill modules while 66 tests stayed green, because nothing asserted that the
modules import at all.

So import each one directly, outside the swallowing loader, and let the
traceback through.
