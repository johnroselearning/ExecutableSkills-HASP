"""The skill library's on-disk layout, pinned.

`skills/` is split by what a skill is, then by domain:

    textual/<domain>/<skill_id>/SKILL.md      cards only — no code
    executable/<domain>/skills.py             every skill declared once
    executable/docs/<domain>/<skill_id>/      their cards, kept apart from the code

Several consumers depend on that shape — the pf_select menu, training's rollout
runner, forge's emit stage, and the run-scoped copies evolving makes. These
tests fail if a move breaks any of them, which is the point: the last
reorganisation broke three consumers silently and each was found by counting
afterwards.
