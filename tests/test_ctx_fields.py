"""Every `ctx.<field>` a skill reads must be a field `Ctx` actually declares.

This is the guard that makes attribute access safer than the dict it replaced.
`ctx.raed_count` raises at runtime — but a Detect that raises declines, and a
skill that always declines looks exactly like a skill that never matches. Three
skills were lost that way during the template migration, none with a traceback.

So the check runs by AST over the source, without importing or dispatching
anything: it needs no rollout to reach the typo, and it names the file and the
attribute rather than leaving a silent abstention to be noticed months later.
