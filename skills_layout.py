"""Where the skill library lives, and how to load it.

`skills/` is split two ways — by what a skill *is*, then by domain:

    skills/
    ├── textual/<domain>/          prose-only PFs: they fire on a trigger and
    │   ├── <skill_id>/SKILL.md    inject a fixed reminder. The document IS the
    │   └── dynamic_program_functions.py                              skill.
    └── executable/
        ├── <domain>/evidence_pfs.py     the skill: a checker that re-verifies
        │                                a claim the model wrote
        └── docs/<domain>/<skill_id>/SKILL.md    its card — what the policy
                                                 reads when it picks a PF

Under `executable/` the code and the documents are kept apart on purpose: the
checker is the skill, and a tree of SKILL.md sitting next to it reads as though
the prose were.

Both halves of a domain are one library at runtime: `dynamic_program_functions.py`
chain-loads its sibling `evidence_pfs.py`, and where both register the same
`skill_id` the executable one wins (it is loaded last).

Callers should not join these paths by hand. `resolve()` takes whatever a config
or a CLI flag carries and returns the directories to scan and the modules to
exec-import, so a layout change lands here rather than in six call sites.
